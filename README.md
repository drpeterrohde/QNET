# QNET

Qnet will be an extention for the Python module NetworkX, which I'm currently developping under the supervision of 
Dr. Peter Rohde. Our intention is to produce a package capable of simulating realistic quantum networks on a graph 
theoretical level and provide users with intuitive tools for:

* Developing and testing new local protocols for quantum internet
* Implementing contemporary strategies for entanglement distribution such as through entanglement purification and 
entanglement swapping 
* Generating quantum networks of different sizes and topologies
* Evaluating costs unique to quantum communications such as coherence and fidelity 
* Simulating quantum networks with global satellite constellations.

## Installation

TODO

## Usage

Use the Demo.py file to plot path costs over time for various graph structures
contained in (Graph1.py, Graph2.py ... GraphN.py) Simply uncomment the line
of code corresponding to a specific graph.
