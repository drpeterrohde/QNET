    '''
    Plots probability of path exisiting, efficiency and fidelity of the shortest path in a graph. 
    
    Constructs a regular lattice and then makes defects in it for different probability thresholds. 
    Calculates the probability of path exisiting, efficiency and fidelity of the shortest path in 
    these defected graphs using Monte-Carlo iteration.  

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : int
        Number of columns in the regular lattice.
    y : int
        Number of rows in the regular lattice.
    e : float
        Efficiency of a single channel in the regular lattice. 
    pz : float
        Probability of state not undergoing dephasing in the regular lattice. 

    Returns
    -------
    None.
